    <title>An awesome blog</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <h1>An awesome blog</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <h2>An awesome blog post</h2>
        <!-- <img src="./images/window.png" alt="window" /> -->
        <!-- ! make sure to write descriptive alt texts -->
        <img
          src="images/window.png"
          alt="A bright yellow window with plants in front, on a blue wall."
        />
        <p>
          While making this web page I learned how to write
          <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/alt-text"
            >descriptive and specific alt texts for images</a
          >
          It's important for accesibility, for when images won't load and it
          also helps with SEO.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also learned some rules of how margins work. Something I wish I knew
          earlier was how margins will
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing"
            >merge into one another</a
          >, causing only the larger margin to be visible. This can even occur
          with the top margins of a parent element and its first child element.
          Another interesting thing is that, by default, text has top and bottom
          margins equal to its font-size.
        </p>
        <!-- ! give the last paragraph a class to remove the bottom margin -->
        <p class="read-more"><a href="../index.html">Read more...</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
