        <h2>I Am a Developer</h2>

        <p>
          I used to be a computer science student at the University of Auckland.
          There was so much to learn that I felt I was supposed to appreciate,
          but I just couldn't. The truth is, a lot of it didn't feel useful to
          me and it really wasn't. I don't want to be a computer scientist, but
          there weren't other options for me wanting to get into software
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          This doesn't mean I did badly, I just found most of it incredibly
          boring which in turn made it difficult at times to motivate myself to
          do any work. I spent most of my time hanging out with friends, playing
          video games or working on (actually practical)
          <a href="https://github.com/dbedggood">personal software projects</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>My Last Semester at University</h3>
        <p>
          In my last semester I didn't have much left to do. I took my final
          stage 3 paper, and then 3 other stage 1 papers just to fill out my
          degree planner. This gave me a little more time on the side to work on
          myself and line up a job for after I finish studying.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked on a few more projects, learned a few new skills, attended a
          couple hackathons and made a few more friends. However, there were
          (and still are) hardly any jobs out there for junior developers like
          me, and all the graduate programmes start at the beginning of next
          year. This made things really hard for me, I wasn't successful in my
          job hunt and I felt like I would never be able to find a job.
        </p>
        <h3>I Still Haven't Found a Job</h3>
        <p>
          I've been living off of Jobseeker Support (which has been incredibly
          helpful) as I apply to every developer job I can. It's really
          difficult because there are actually so many jobs out there, but it
          feels as if 99% of them require at least a couple years of commercial
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          However difficult it may be, I know that I am trying my best. Which is
          why I have forgiven myself for not being able to find work straight
          after University. I'm still young and there is no real rush to start
          my career, I could always wait until the graduate programmes start
          early next year. I am incredibly grateful to have people that support
          me and I hope that I can make them proud sooner than later.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not applying for jobs, I'm working on developing my skills
          and growing myself to be more attractive to potential employers. This
          site and the
          <a href="../index.html">others</a> are an example of me trying to
          improve my proficiency in CSS. I'm doing this by reviewing the
          fundamentals and learning how create responsive websites and more
          without any CSS frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something else I'm working on is a
          <a href="https://renachua.com/">website</a> for my lovely girlfriend,
          Rena (pictured above). I created it with React, Redux and Firebase.
          The layout is made with a CSS framework called Materialize. I'm
          planning to revamp the UX once I master pure CSS.
